# Bare Minimum DSA Topics for Interviews

## 1. Core Data Structures
- **Arrays & Strings**
  - Sliding window, two pointers
  - Prefix sums
  - Basic string manipulation
- **Linked Lists**
  - Reversal, cycle detection (Floyd’s cycle)
  - Merge two sorted lists
- **Stacks & Queues**
  - Monotonic stack/queue
  - Implement stack/queue using other DS
  - Parentheses matching
- **Hashing (HashMap/HashSet)**
  - Frequency maps
  - Detect duplicates
  - Subarray sum problems
- **Trees**
  - Binary trees: traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order)
  - Binary Search Tree: insert, search, delete
  - Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
- **Heaps / Priority Queue**
  - K largest/smallest elements
  - Heap-based scheduling
- **Graphs (basic level)**
  - BFS, DFS
  - Connected components
  - Topological sort (DAGs)

---

## 2. Algorithms
- **Sorting**
  - Quick sort, Merge sort (understand, not memorize code)
  - Sorting with custom comparators
- **Searching**
  - Binary search (and applications like search in rotated array, peak finding, etc.)
- **Recursion & Backtracking**
  - Subsets, permutations, N-Queens, Sudoku
- **Greedy**
  - Interval scheduling (activity selection)
  - Minimum coins / change-making
- **Dynamic Programming (only essentials)**
  - Fibonacci / Climbing Stairs (basic DP pattern)
  - Knapsack (0/1, unbounded)
  - Longest Common Subsequence / Substring
  - Longest Increasing Subsequence
  - DP on grids (unique paths, min path sum)

---

## 3. Problem-Solving Patterns
- Sliding window
- Two pointers
- Fast & slow pointer (tortoise-hare)
- Divide & conquer
- Binary search on answer
- Union-Find (disjoint sets) – optional for entry-level

---

## 4. Other Important Things
- **Big-O Analysis**: Be able to reason about time & space complexity.
- **Coding fluency**: Practice writing clean, bug-free code in your main interview language.
- **System Design Basics** (for mid/senior): Caching, scalability, load balancing.

✅ If you’re just starting, **Arrays, Strings, Hashing, Binary Search, Linked Lists, Stacks/Queues, and Basic DP** will already cover ~70% of interview questions.  
The rest (Trees, Graphs, Advanced DP) is icing on the cake for tougher companies.
